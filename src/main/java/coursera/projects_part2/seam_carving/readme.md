###Programming Assignment 2: Seam Carving

[Assignment Specification](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/seam/specification.php)
___
####Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height (or width) at a time. A vertical seam in an image is a path of pixels connected from the top to the bottom with one pixel in each row.
***
**Performance requirements.** The width(), height(), and energy() methods should take constant time in the worst case. All other methods should run in time at most proportional to width Ã— height in the worst case. For faster performance, do not construct explicit DirectedEdge and EdgeWeightedDigraph objects.
