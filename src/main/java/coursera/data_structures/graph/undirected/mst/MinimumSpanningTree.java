/**
 * MST algorithms (Minimum Spanning Tree)
 * A spanning tree of Graph_2642 (G) is a SubGraph T that is both a tree  (connected and acyclic) and spanning (includes all the vertices).
 * Greedy algorithm :
 * Choose cut(сечение графа) and color minimum weight - it will be MST edge
 * Choose another cut which doesn't contain colored edge and repeat.
 * <p>
 * Algorithms difference is in procedure of chooosing cut.
