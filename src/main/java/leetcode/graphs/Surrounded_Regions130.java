/**
 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
 * <p>
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
 * <p>
 * Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped
 * to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
 * Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
